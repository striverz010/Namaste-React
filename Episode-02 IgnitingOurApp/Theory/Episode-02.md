# Q: What is `Bundler`?
A bundler in React is a tool that allows developers to package their code into a single file or bundle.Common bundlers used with React are `Webpack` and `Parcel`.
In other words, a bundler is a tool that helps you `manage the dependencies` and assets of your React application, and package them into a single file (or a few files) that can be served to the browser.

# Q: What is `npm`?
* `npm` is the default package manager for Node.js and is written entirely in Javascript.A package contains all the files needed for a module and modules are the JavaScript libraries that can be included in Node project according to the requirement of the project.
* NPM can install all the dependencies of a project through the package.json file.
* npm consists of three distinct components:
* `the website`
* `the Command Line Interface (CLI)`
* `the registry`
## How to initialize `npm`
```
npm init
```
* `npm init -y` it will skips all the options.

# Q: What is parcel? and why do we need it?
Parcel is a popular web application bundler, a tool used in web development to package various web assets like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images into a format that browsers can understand and load efficiently.
`parcle` is a beast do you know why?
```
* HMR(HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT)
* FWR(FILE WATCHER ALGORITHM)
* BUNDILING
* MINIFYING
* CLEANING OUR CODE
* IMAGE OPTIMIZATION
* CACHING WHILE DEVELOPMENT
* COMPRESSION -->(heading -->f)
* COMPATIBLE WITH OLDER VERSION BROWSERS
```
### installation commands:
- Install:
```
npm install -D parcel
```
`-D` is used for development and as a development dependency.

- Parcel Commands :
    - For development build:
    ```
    npx parcel <entry_point> 
    ```
    - For production build :
    ```
    npx parcel build <entry_point> 
    ```
# What is `package.json` and `package-lock.json` ?
`package.json` is a metadata file in a Node.js project that describes the project's dependencies, scripts, configuration, and other details.

## Tilde (~) and carat (^), and their difference
npm versions are written in 0.0.0 formats where first number(from left) statnd for major release,second for the minor release and the third for the latest patch release of this particular version.Patch updates transcend to bug fixes.
### ~ 
* freezes major and minor versions and allow only patch versions.
* `~1.2.0` --> 1.2.0 to 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3 etc.

### ^
* freezes the major version and allow minor and patch versions.
* `^1.2.0`  -->  1.3.1

`package-lock.json` file is like a one-stop solution of your entire problem. package-lock.json is a file that is automatically generated by npm when a package is installed. It records the exact version of every installed dependency, including its sub-dependencies and their versions.

# Q: what is `npx`?;
NPX: The `npx` stands for `Node Package Execute` and it comes with the npm, when you installed npm above 5.2.0 version then automatically npx will installed. It is an npm package runner that can execute any package that you want from the npm registry without even installing that package. The npx is useful during a single time use package. If you have installed npm below 5.2.0 then npx is not installed in your system. 

# Q: what is `node_modules` is it? good `idea to push node_modules into the git`?
The node_modules folder is a directory that is created when you install modules using npm. It contains all of the dependencies for your project, including the modules themselves, their dependencies, and so on.
It is generally not a good idea to push the node_modules folder to git. This is because it can be very large, and it can change frequently as you install new modules or update existing ones. This can make it difficult to track changes to your project, and it can also make it difficult to deploy your project to production.

# Q: What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
A .gitignore file is a plain text file that contains a list of all the specified files and folders from the project that Git should ignore and not track.
For example, if you have a project that uses a lot of third-party libraries, you might add a line like this to your .gitignore file:
``` 
node_modules/
 ```
This would tell Git to ignore all of the files and folders in the node_modules/ directory

# Q: What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?
`Dependencies`: In package.json file, there is an object called dependencies and it consists of all the packages that are used in the project with its version number. So, whenever you install any library that is required in your project that library you can find it in the dependencies object. 
`Syntax`:
```
npm install <package name>
```
`Dev Dependencies`: In package.json file, there is an object called as dev Dependencies and it consists of all the packages that are used in the project in its development phase and not in the production or testing environment with its version number. So, whenever you want to install any library that is required only in your development phase then you can find it in the dev Dependencies object. 

`Syntax`:

```
npm install <package_name> --save-dev
          or
npm install -D <package_name>
```

# Q: What is `Tree Shaking`?
The removal of unwanted code or dead code is called tree shaking,generally bundlers such as webpack, parcle will take care about these unwanted code.
Tree shaking refers to dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process.
When we `import` and `export` modules in JavaScript, most of the time there is unused code floating around. Excluding that unused code (also referred as dead code) is called `tree shaking`.

# Q: Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
You should not modify the package-lock.json file unless you are actively updating the required packages. 
The package-lock.json file is a generated file that tracks the exact version of every package installed. 
It ensures that everyone working on the project has the same dependencies installed. This helps to avoid version conflicts and ensures that the project can be built and run consistently across different environments. 

# Q: What is .parcel-cache?
The `.parcel-cache`  folder stores information about your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode.

# Q: What is the dist folder?
The dist folder is a folder that contains the minimized version of source code. It's used for production web applications.
