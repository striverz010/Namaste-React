npm versions are written in 0.0.0 formats where first number(from left) statnd for major release,second for the minor release and the third for the latest patch release of this particular version.Patch updates transcend to bug fixes.
### ~

`package-lock.json` file is like a one-stop solution of your entire problem. package-lock.json is a file that is automatically generated by npm when a package is installed. It records the exact version of every installed dependency, including its sub-dependencies and their versions.
